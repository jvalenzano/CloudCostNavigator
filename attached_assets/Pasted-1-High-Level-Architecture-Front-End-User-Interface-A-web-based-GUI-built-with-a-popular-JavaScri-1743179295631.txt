1. High-Level Architecture
Front End (User Interface)

A web-based GUI built with a popular JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular) or a lightweight library (e.g., Svelte).

Provides wizard-like, step-by-step forms and dynamic cost visualizations (e.g., bar charts, sliders, or real-time estimate displays).

Back End (Application Layer)

A simple REST API built with Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, or Python/FastAPI.

Integrates with pricing data from cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and HPC platforms (SCINet, Cyverse), either by calling live APIs (if available) or referencing internally cached data tables.

Data Layer

Cloud Provider Pricing APIs where available:

AWS Price List API: Access on-demand and spot instance pricing.

GCP Pricing Catalog API: Provide cost references for on-demand and preemptible VMs.

Azure Retail Prices Endpoint: (Beta) for Azure VM pricing.

Local Config/Database for HPC or specialized platform cost data (e.g., SCINet, Cyverse) if they don’t offer an external API.

Caching & Refresh mechanism to regularly update pricing data (daily, weekly, or monthly).

Additional Services (Optional)

Authentication/Authorization (if the tool is for internal use only).

Analytics Logging to track which configurations users commonly explore.

Automated Testing & CI/CD to ensure reliability when data updates or new features roll out.

2. Suggested Technology Stack
Front End

React: Popular, robust ecosystem for building dynamic forms and real-time charts (e.g., with Recharts, Chart.js, or D3.js).

TypeScript: Enhances code maintainability and reduces runtime bugs.

UI Libraries: Material-UI (for React), Vuetify (for Vue), or Chakra UI can provide ready-made components that make layout and styling easier.

Back End

Node.js + Express:

Lightweight, straightforward to handle REST endpoints.

Ecosystem has plenty of libraries for calling external APIs.

OR Python + Flask/FastAPI:

Clear syntax, easy to read, and robust for small to mid-size APIs.

Good for data manipulation and HPC-like scripts if needed.

Database / Caching

NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) or a simple PostgreSQL/MySQL if you need to store user preferences or scenario definitions.

Redis or in-memory caching to store frequently accessed pricing data and reduce external API calls.

Deployment

Internal servers or containers (Docker + Kubernetes) if your organization supports container-based deployments.

Secure behind organizational authentication (e.g., Single Sign-On).

3. Data Ingestion & Pricing Integration
Cloud Provider Pricing APIs

AWS Price List API (docs):

Query Spot pricing for EC2.

Filter by instance type, region, OS, etc.

GCP Pricing Catalog API (docs):

Retrieve on-demand and preemptible VM rates.

Azure Retail Prices (docs):

Still in preview or beta in some regions, but offers VM pricing.

HPC & Other Platforms (SCINet, Cyverse)

Likely no direct public APIs. Create a static JSON or small database table with known cost structures:

For example, SCINet might have an approximate annual cost (like $19,762) or an hourly overhead.

Cyverse might have usage-based rates or rely on grant-based allocations.

Caching Strategy

Scheduled Cron Job (daily/weekly) to fetch the latest provider pricing.

Store it locally in a database or JSON file.

Serve from the local store for faster user experience and to avoid hitting rate limits.

4. UI/UX Design for a Frictionless Experience
Wizard-Style Flow

Step 1: Basic Info (e.g., “How many vCPUs / how much memory do you need?” “How long do you plan to run?” “Can you tolerate interruptions?”)

Step 2: Platform Options (AWS, Azure, GCP, HPC) with recommended ephemeral compute configurations (Spot vs. On-Demand, Preemptible, ephemeral disks).

Step 3: Estimates & Comparison (real-time or near real-time chart + table comparing approximate monthly or total job cost).

Default Parameters + Quick Edits

Provide sane defaults: e.g., 4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM, 8 hours per day, preemptible/spot.

Let users tweak these values with sliders or dropdowns.

Recalculate automatically on change, showing cost deltas.

Visual Feedback

Charts to illustrate cost across providers in a bar chart or line graph.

“What If” toggles for preemptible vs. on-demand, increasing concurrency, or expanding runtime.

Tooltips & Contextual Help

Explain ephemeral compute, spot/preemptible, HPC, etc. in short pop-ups.

Provide disclaimers about potential termination or HPC usage restrictions.

5. Sample Workflow & Minimal Code Snippet
5.1 Overall Workflow
User Visits internal URL: https://ephemeral-calculator.internal/.

Step-by-Step Inputs: CPU/Memory, usage pattern (hours/day, concurrency), region, interruption tolerance.

Back End Logic:

Calls or references your cached pricing data.

Calculates total estimated cost for each provider, factoring ephemeral discounts (spot, preemptible, etc.).

Front End Render:

Displays the results in a table or chart.

Optionally, a link to the official calculators with pre-filled settings for deeper customization.
